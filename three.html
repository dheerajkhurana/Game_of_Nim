            Rules & About 'Game of NIM' (Also the Logic behind it!)

                Rules of the Game of NIM: There are n piles of coins. When it is a players turn he chooses one pile and takes at least one coin from it. If someone is unable to move he loses (so the one who removes the last coin is the winner).

            <h3 class="hello">
                -	XOR of two logic values is true if and only if one of them is true and the second is false
-	when computing XOR of integers, first write them as binary numbers and then apply XOR on columns.
-	so XOR of even number of 1s is 0 and XOR of odd number of 1s is 1
<br>
<br>
Why does it work?<br>
-	From the losing positions we can move only to the winning ones:<br>
- If XOR of the sizes of the piles is 0 then it will be changed after our move (at least one 1 will be changed to 0, so in that column will be odd number of 1s).<br>
- From the winning positions it is possible to move to at least one losing:<br>
- If XOR of the sizes of the piles is not 0 we can change it to 0 by finding the left most column where the number of 1s is odd, changing one of them to 0 and then by changing 0s or 1s on the right side of it to gain even number of 1s in every column.
<br>
<br>
Examples:

Position (1, 2, 3) is losing because 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = (1)2 XOR (10)2 XOR (11)2 = 0
Position (7, 4, 1) is winning because 7 XOR 4 XOR 1 = (111)2 XOR (100)2 XOR (1)2 = (10)2 = 2

                The CityU Nim is based around the theme that there is a fire in the CityU residence and as a firefighter, you are supposed to get all
the students out of their respective halls. In a single move you can take any number of students out of at most one hall. After your move, the computer takes over,
and in a similar manner takes any number of students out of any hall of its choice. The one who takes out the last set of student wins
