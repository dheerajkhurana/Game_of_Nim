Claude Elwood Shannon was an American mathematician, electrical engineer, and cryptographer known as "the father of information theory".
Shannon is noted for having founded information theory with a landmark paper, A Mathematical Theory of Communication, that he published in 1948. He is perhaps equally well known for founding digital circuit design theory in 1937, when, as a 21-year-old master's degree student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he wrote his thesis demonstrating that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical, numerical relationship.
            <h3 class="hee">
Shannon is as the founding father of electronic communications age since he noticed and discovered the similarity between Boolean algebra and the telephone switching circuits. For example, the fundamental unit of information is a yes-no situation. Either something is or is not. This can be easily expressed in Boolean two-value binary algebra by 1 and 0, so that 1 means "on" when the switch is closed and the power is on, and 0 means "off" when the switch is open and power is off.


Under these circumstances, 1 and 0 are binary digits, a phrase that can be shortened to "bits." Thus the unit of information is the bit. A more complicated information can be viewed as built up out of combinations of bits.

By 1948, He turned his efforts toward a fundamental understanding of the problem and had evolved a method of expressing information in quantitative form.
Conclusion

Shannon is a living legend at seventy-nine. What made him stand out from others mathematician is that he never content just to know a topic well. He constantly rearranges it, tries it in different settings, until he gets it into form in which he explain it, sometime literally, to the people in the street. He is the founding father who laid down its most important principles. His contributions are saluted by the world and his work not only helped translate circuit design from an art into a science, but its central tenet.
